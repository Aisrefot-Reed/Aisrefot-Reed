# ðŸ’« About Me:
I am studying manual testing, gradually delving into the world of automation. In the process of mastering QA, I also became interested in machine learning - I implemented several projects, trained neural networks, dealt with architectures and metrics.

In parallel, I am developing the skill of writing articles: I try to share practical observations, interesting cases and useful conclusions from my own experience.

- Now I combine the study of testing with technical creativity - I want to combine a high-quality approach to software testing with the intellectual capabilities of ML.
